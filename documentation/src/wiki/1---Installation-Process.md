## Prerequisites

To be able to install the project on your own Microsoft 365 Tenant, you have to

* be at least a regular user of the tenant
* have access to Microsoft Teams 
* have access to Microsoft Power Apps

If you meet the requirements, the installation consists of 2 fairly simple steps:

1. import the required project data from Microsoft Excel files into SharePoint lists.
1. import the Power App and restore the connections to the imported lists.
