## Importing and configuring the Power App

In this second step, the PowerApp must now be imported and its settings adjusted in relation to the storage location of the data imported in step 1.

### Importing the Power App
### Course of Action

Select the waffle menu in the upper left corner and select the Microsoft 365 solution "Power Apps". If the app is not listed, click "All Apps" in the top left menu and then select "Power Apps".

Now select the menu item "Apps" in the left menu and then select "Import Canvas App" at the top of the window.

Then click on the "Upload" button and upload the previously downloaded zip file "TreasureHunt_<your_version_number>.zip".

> Attention: It is crucial that you upload the app's zip file as is, please do __not__ unzip this file.

> Attention: Before the import can start, the following setting must be changed:

* In the column "Import Setup" click on "Update" and select "Create as new" instead.
* Now click on the "Import" button.

### Configuring the imported Power App
We have now successfully imported the Power App. The last step is to reconnect the 
SharePoint lists from step 1 with the just imported app.

### Course of Action

Select the "Apps" menu item in the left menu and then open the "Edit" menu item by selecting 
the "..." menu item after the name of the app you just imported.

> Please note that it may take a little while for the app to show up in the list of available apps. Be patient and reload the page if necessary.

Since the Power App needs access to the previously imported lists in SharePoint at runtime, 
as well as to information from the Microsoft Teams context in which it is running, 
you must now confirm that the app is allowed to do this on your behalf.  

![Edit PowerApps](./img/25_Allow-permissions.png) 

To update the connection to SharePoint lists, click the Database icon in 
the left menu bar of the current view. 

![Edit PowerApps](./img/26_Settings.png) 

The four listed SharePoint lists must now be removed briefly by right-clicking on each one.

 ![Edit PowerApps](./img/27_Delete_Lists.png)

 ![Edit PowerApps](./img/28_Remove-SharePoint-Lists.png)

Now we set the new connections to the lists.

* To do this, click on "Add Data" in the left menu.
* Select "SharePoint" under Connectors

> If the Sharepoint Connector is not displayed by default, you can search for it in the search box under "Select a data source" by entering the keyword "sharepoint".

![Edit PowerApps](./img/29_Add-new-lists.png)

Then, in the "Connect to a SharePoint site" field, find the SharePoint site of your 
team that you created in the first installation step, e.g. "Treasure Hunt App". 

> If the matching SharePoint page is not displayed under "Recent Sites", add the URL of the site in the upper field by hand.

![Edit PowerApps](./img/30_Connect-SharePoint.png)

After selecting the appropriate Treasure Hunt SharePoint site, 
the four previously imported lists will be displayed. 

Select these four lists by ticking them:

![Edit PowerApps](./img/31_Choose-lists.png)

Now the four selected lists are automatically reconnected to the Power App in the background.

To save your changes, go to the menu item "File" and click on "Save".

![Edit PowerApps](./img/32_Go-to-file.png)

![Edit PowerApps](./img/33_Save.png)

Now you can publish the app. 
You need to confirm that you want to publish the edited version:

![Edit PowerApps](./img/34_publish.png) ![Edit PowerApps](./img/35_Commit-Publish.png)

Now that the app is published, it must be shared so that it is playable not only for 
you but also for your colleagues. To do this, click on the "Share" button. 

![Edit PowerApps](./img/36_Share.png)

Now you have to specify who should have access to the app.
Enter "all" in the input field and then select "All Users" from the drop-down list that appears.

Next, it is best to __uncheck__ the "Send an email invitation to new users" field, 
otherwise __all people__ in your organization would be notified automatically.

Now the installation process is complete and it's time to play a first round of 
Treasure Hunt in any channel in any team you want.
