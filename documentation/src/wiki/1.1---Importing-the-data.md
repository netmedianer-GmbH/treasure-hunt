## Creating The Treasure Hunt Home Team
The Power Apps application that will be imported in the next step needs a central location where its data can be stored and accessed in SharePoint lists.

The easiest way to create this central location is to create a corresponding Microsoft Teams team and then import the lists on the SharePoint side of the team.

No matter how many teams are played in later, all users will need to have access to this central SharePoint list data.

### Course of Action

1. Create a new team, preferably with a descriptive name like "Treasure Hunt App" or "Treasure Hunt Installation".

2. Now open in your new team via the menu item "..." the item "Open in SharePoint".

## Downloading the latest release

To be able to perform the installation, you should download the latest version of the installation files.

All necessary files for the current release can be downloaded from our [Github releases](https://github.com/netmedianer-GmbH/treasure-hunt/releases) page.

Specifically, download these following files:

* TH_Configuration.xlsx
* TH_I18N.xlsx
* TH_Questions.xlsx
* TH_Teams.xlsx
* TreasureHunt_<version_specific_data_and_time>.zip

## Importing the Data
The next step is to import the appropriate data from the Excel files into SharePoint lists.

### Course of Action
To do this, go to "Home" in the left menu and select the "+ New" button and then the "List" menu item.

Select the option "From Excel".

 Now upload the four previously downloaded Excel files one after the other.
It is best to start with the list "TH_Configuration".

> Important: The following settings must be adjusted when uploading the lists:

* Remove the sequence of numbers and letters after the actual list name (This applies to all four lists)

![Add Lists](./img/9_Change_Name.png)

* Now click again on the menu item "Home" in the left navigation and upload the next list.

> Note: Remember to delete the sequence of numbers and letters at the end of the names of all four lists.

> Note: For the two lists "TH_I18N" and "TH_Questions", the field type must be changed to "Choice" for the "Locale" field.

![Add Lists](./img/12_ListI18N_Local_Choice.png)

> Please check: Did you remember to do this step for the TH_Questions list as well?

Now you should have imported all four lists with the following names:

* TH_Configuration
* TH_Teams
* TH_Questions
* TH_I18N

## Ready for Part Two of the Installation Procedure
The first step is completed, the data for the Treasure Hunt app has been successfully imported.
Now it's time to import the app itself, and connect it to the data you just imported.
