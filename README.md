## Welcome to the Treasure Hunt PowerApp

The Treasure Hunt Power App is a project for the simple playful development of skills and knowledge in the use of Microsoft 365.

With the help of especially developed learning paths, embedded in topic-related stories, the user is introduced to the effective use of the various solutions in Microsoft 365 with the help of challenges as well as the underlying learning content, all in the spirit of the gamification approach.
The project was initiated by Microsoft. The content design and the development of the basic application were carried out by Microsoft and netmedianer GmbH.

Special emphasis was put on the simplest possible installation procedure, so that users without administrative rights are able to use the application with the least possible licensing requirements.

The technical basis is based on the three components Microsoft Teams as the runtime environment, SharePoint Lists as the place of data storage and Microsoft Power Apps for the creation of the application and the user interface itself.
